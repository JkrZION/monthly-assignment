# Second-Monthly-Project
 This is my first Portfolio and this is still in the sample state.
 I write each of every nested class in that <section> or <div>  everytime I recall a class-name in CSS in order to make maintainance an easy work in the future.
 Eq.     .about .about-content .about-content-inner p span{}
